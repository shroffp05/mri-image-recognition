<h4> Running the app locally </h4> 

We suggest you to create a separate virtual environment running Python 3 for this app, and install all of the required dependencies there. Run in Terminal/Command Prompt:

```
git clone https://github.com/shroffp05/msca-37011-deep-learning.git
cd apps
python3 -m virtualenv venv
```

In UNIX system: 
```
source venv/bin/activate
```

In Windows:
```
venv\Scripts\activate 
```

To install all the required packages to this environment, simply run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

and all the required pip packages will be installed, and the app will be able to run.
