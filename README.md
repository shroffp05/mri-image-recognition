# Image Recognition Models for tagging MRI Images                 

Part of the Deep Learning and Image Recognition class at the University of Chicago's Master of Science in Analytics program 

## Project Intro/Objective
For this project we have developed our own Image Recognition model and compared it with VGG16 (<i>transfer learning</i>) for predicting the severity of Alzheimer's using MRI Images. The model is hosted on a streamlit app to view with different MRI images. 

## Methods Used
- CNN 
- Transfer Learning 
- Image Augmentation 
- StreamLit 

## Technologies 
- Python 
- Google Colab 

## Dataset 
Dataset with more information can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sachinkumar413/alzheimer-mri-dataset)

The dataset consists of 6400 MRI images (128x128), broken into 4 categories:
- Mild Demented
- Very Mild Demented 
- Moderate Demented 
- Non Demented

## Methdology

To classify MRI images we compared two different models:

- Convolutional Neural network with 2 layers
- VGG 16 Model 

For each model we compared to datasets, one that was augmented and the original
