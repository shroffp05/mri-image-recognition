# Image Recognition Models for tagging MRI Images 
----------
Part of the Deep Learning and Image Recognition class at the University of Chicago's Master of Science in Analytics program 

## Project Intro/Objective
-----------
For this project we have developed our own Image Recognition model and compared it with VGG16 (<i>transfer learning</i>) for predicting the severity of Alzheimer's using MRI Images. The model is hosted on a streamlit app to view with different MRI images. 

## Methods Used
----------
- CNN 
- Transfer Learning 
- Image Augmentation 
- StreamLit 

## Technologies 
----------
- Python 
- Google Colab
